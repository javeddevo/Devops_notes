Jenkins is a Java application, so the first step is to install Java. Run the following command to install the OpenJDK 8 package:

sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
Copy
The current version of Jenkins does not support Java 10 (and Java 11) yet. If you have multiple versions of Java installed on your machine make sure Java 8 is the default Java version.

The next step is to enable the Jenkins repository. To do that, import the GPG key using the following curl command:

curl --silent --location http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo
Copy
And add the repository to your system with:

sudo rpm --import https://jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins-ci.org.key

Once the repository is enabled, install the latest stable version of Jenkins by typing:

sudo yum install jenkins

After the installation process is completed, start the Jenkins service with:

sudo systemctl start jenkins
Copy
To check whether it started successfully run:

systemctl status jenkins


Finally enable the Jenkins service to start on system boot.

sudo systemctl enable jenkins

jenkins.service is not a native service, redirecting to /sbin/chkconfig.
Executing /sbin/chkconfig jenkins on

Adjust the Firewall
If you are installing Jenkins on a remote CentOS server that is protected by a firewall you need to port 8080.

Use the following commands to open the necessary port:

sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
