DOCKER:
-------
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, andship it all out as one package.

------------------------------------
TO INSTALL DOCKER ON UBUNTU 16.04
------------------------------------
1.First, in order to ensure the downloads are valid, add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:

$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

2.Add the Docker repository to APT sources:

$ sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

3.Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:

$ sudo apt-get update

4.Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu 16.04 repo:

$ apt-cache policy docker-ce

5.Finally, install Docker:
$sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce

6.Docker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot. Check that it's running:

$ sudo systemctl status docker
