DOCKER:It is used to deploy applications easy 
-------
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, andship it all out as one package.

DOCKRER TERMINOLOGIES:

IMAGE:It is a metadata of an os.It cant have memory it just have storage space

CONTAINER:When the image gets executes it has its own running space and all the features of the application.Each container has its own isolated area

TO INSTALL DOCKER ON UBUNTU 16.04
------------------------------------
1.First, in order to ensure the downloads are valid, add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:

$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

2.Add the Docker repository to APT sources:

$ sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

3.Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:

$ sudo apt-get update

4.Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu 16.04 repo:

$ apt-cache policy docker-ce

5.Finally, install Docker:
$sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce

6.Docker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot. Check that it's running:

$ sudo systemctl status docker
--------------------------------------------------------------
1.To see the docker version
$ docker --version

2.Any help from docker
$ docker --help

3.To pull any image from docker hub
$ docker pull image-name

4.To run the image
$ docker run image-name

5.To see the list of images in local repo
$ docker images
--------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:If u want to download the image just give "docker pull image-name.If u want to run the image give"docker run image".If u run the image first it check from the local deamon if not there it checks from the docker hub and executes.docker run image means pull+executes.

1.docker--Client
2.docker deamon-service
3.registry-docker hub
--------------------------------------------------------------
6.To see the running containers
$ docker ps

7.T see the history of cantainers
$ docker ps -a

8.To spinup the container without pulling from dockerhub
$ docker run -it centos "bin/bash"

9.to remove the multiple container at a time
$ docker rm $(docker rm -a -q)
